                    <h3>My journey into software engineering is nascent, but it is already a hobby turned passion turned career.</h3>
                    <h3>I'm currently an apprentice software engineer at Clover/Fiserv, developing full stack proficiency by learning HTML, CSS, javascript and java to build on my strong Python base.</h3>
                    <h3>This website is actually itself a demonstration of my burdgeoning HTML and CSS skills, so I hope you're enjoying it!</h3>
                    <h3>On this page you'll find some examples of projects I've built, along with a brief explanation.</h3>

                        <h3>This project is a webscraper which sells items in a user's steam inventory automatically.</h3>
                        <h3>It installs a browser extension which scrapes for the lowest possible current market price of an item as well as the
                            highest possible instant-sell price, and generates buttons for those options.</h3> 
                        <h3>The scraper I've built then accepts the user's login credentials and 2 factor authentification code, and allows the user to custom select filter options. The 
                            scraper will then sell all items matching the selected filter conditions, preferencing the instant-sell option.
