                    <h3>Defining oneself is impossible without being either verbose or reductive, and here I'll err towards the latter.</h3>
                    <h3>I am driven by the desires to experience and to improve. I am a thrill seeker-I enjoy apline sports, roller coasters and rock climbing.
                        Staying active is important to me so I also play competitive sports like basketball and squash, as they marry my desire for adrenaline and my
                        internal competitiveness well.</h3>
                    <h3>These defining drives have also led me towards self-teaching programming, pushing myself creatively through poetry, music, and acting, and fostering
                        a regular gym habit to stay healthy and strong.</h3>
                    <h3>In that we are all much more than a collection of interests this list is reductive to the point of comedy, but it outlines the shape of my passion,
                        which tend to be the boundaries we color most deeply.</h3>
